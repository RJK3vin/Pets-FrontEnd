# React + Vite

This project was so I can learn how to create my own API using django rest framework.



- The App component manages pet data fetched from my local server allowing users to add new pets and manage their carts. The ShowPets component displays the list of pets. The description component shows a description of the user's selected pet.
- CSS is used for basic inline styling
